# Real-Time Forum

## Project Overview

Real-Time Forum is a full-stack web application built with **Golang**, **SQLite**, **HTML/CSS/JS**, and **WebSockets**.
It is a **Single Page Application (SPA)** where users can register, login, create posts, comment, and chat in real-time.

## ðŸ—“ 10-Day Development Plan

| Day | Task                                                                                      |
| --- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Setup folder structure and empty files, create `index.html` and `style.css`.              |
| 2   | Setup Go server (`main.go`) and serve static frontend files.                              |
| 3   | Connect to SQLite database (`db.go`) and create tables: users, posts, comments, messages. |
| 4   | Implement registration backend (`auth.go`) and connect with `auth.js`.                    |
| 5   | Implement login backend and session handling. Test login/register flows.                  |
| 6   | Implement posts creation and fetching (`posts.js` + handlers.go).                         |
| 7   | Implement comments creation and fetching for posts.                                       |
| 8   | Implement WebSocket hub (`ws.go`) for private messaging.                                  |
| 9   | Implement frontend chat logic (`chat.js`) and real-time updates.                          |
| 10  | Testing, debugging, CSS improvements, final touches, SPA polish.                          |

## ðŸ’¡ Notes

* Always build feature by feature; do not jump to chat before auth works.
* Keep backend and frontend clearly separated.
* Use Go routines and channels for WebSocket real-time handling.
* Debounce/throttle scroll for loading older messages in chat.
* Only **standard Go packages** plus `gorilla/websocket`, `sqlite3`, `bcrypt`, and `uuid` are allowed.
